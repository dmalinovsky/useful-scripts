==============

Assorted collection of misc useful scripts.

* `litres-last.py` allows to download the trial version of the latest book in
[LitRes](http://www.litres.ru/) user basket.  Initially it will ask for
a user credentials, but they won't be saved;  special hash will be used
instead.
* `.vimrc` is my ultimate Vim configuration file.
